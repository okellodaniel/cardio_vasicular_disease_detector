# Cardio Vascular Disease Detector
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death globally, affecting millions annually. Often, CVD progresses undetected until it reaches a critical stage, endangering patients' lives and imposing a significant healthcare burden. Early detection is crucial for enabling timely interventions that improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

The cardio vascular disease detector is a machine learning-powered tool designed to assess an individual's risk of developing CVD. By analyzing key health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors, this model predicts the likelihood of cardiovascular disease, providing healthcare providers and patients with valuable, data-driven insights.

This project is focused on shifting from reactive treatment to proactive prevention, helping identify cardiovascular risks early and supporting informed decision-making for healthier lives.

## Problem Statement:

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality globally. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention and management. Utilizing the Cardiovascular Disease dataset from Kaggle, which comprises 70,000 patient records with 13 features, this project aims to develop a predictive model to assess an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The model will analyze patient data to provide timely risk assessments, thereby aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and potentially improving patient outcomes.
